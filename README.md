## Details
This module's contents are based off of those of the [r29 (print) release](https://basicfantasy.org/downloads/Basic-Fantasy-Field-Guide-r29.pdf) of the Basic Fantasy Field Guide Volume 1 with the following modifications and additions:
* perceived spelling and grammar mistakes were corrected
* creatures that have multiple variants were each given their own actor sheets for each variant
* creatures with multiple attack options had their attack routines clarified (e.g. some monsters can attack with a claw and a bite, and some can attack with a claw OR a bite)
* mechanics for monsters were removed from the description and placed either with the attacks they accompany or in their own "special abilities" entry
* monsters which can cast spells were given a pre-selected list of spells, so that they may be used without any GM preparation
* minor mechanical corrections for monsters with mismatched values (e.g. HD/XP, saves, attack bonuses) either within their statblock or their descriptions
* monster attacks were given a pawprint symbol for attacks natural to them (claws, tails, etc.) and a sword symbol for weapons

##To-Do
* Update monsters to match the latest digital release of the BFRPG Field Guide, if applicable
* Map monsters to tokens which actually represent them, using artwork from the Field Guide, getting permission from their artists if necessary
* Create artwork for monsters which do not have any
